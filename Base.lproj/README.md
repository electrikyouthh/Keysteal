# KeySteal
KeySteal is a macOS <= 10.14.3 Keychain exploit that allows you to access passwords inside the Keychain without a user prompt. The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2019-8526 number.  
KeySteal consists of two parts:
1. KeySteal Daemon: This is a daemon that exploits securityd to get a session that is allowed to access the Keychain without a password prompt.
2. KeySteal Client: This is a library that can be injected into Apps. It will automatically apply a patch that forces the Security Framework to use the session of our keysteal daemon.

# Building and Running
1. Open the KeySteal Xcode Project
2. Build the keystealDaemon and keystealClient
3. Open the directory which contains the built daemon and client (right cick on keystealDaemon -> Open in Finder)
4. Run dump-keychain.sh
